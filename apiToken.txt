It looks like I can get assignments for courses.  So I need to figure out how to get courses and then get assignments for courses.

get courses: curl https://capital.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/ \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer 21348~Ac6ZeD9nMTxpk2GG1k1sXlDwQSn5dQcx7gkiMxfyUNgjfnQKbiFVgch57iPp0B5b'

get assignments: /api/v1/courses/:course_id/assignments
	curl https://capital.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/:course_id/assigments \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer 21348~Ac6ZeD9nMTxpk2GG1k1sXlDwQSn5dQcx7gkiMxfyUNgjfnQKbiFVgch57iPp0B5b'

What is a valid course ID?
	1778

working command for some course:
curl https://capital.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/1778/assignments \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer 21348~Ac6ZeD9nMTxpk2GG1k1sXlDwQSn5dQcx7gkiMxfyUNgjfnQKbiFVgch57iPp0B5b'

Data I need:
	get courses - All course IDs: Use the "id" field, also get name with the "name" field
	get assignments - Due Dates of Assignments:in list of objects, each assignment has a "due_at"
	get assignments - Name of Assignments: return is a list of objects, they have a "name" field

I would like to try doing this in Go, meets in the middle between Python and C.  I do not need a database since I want to transfer information into google calendar.  I need to figure out how to access google calendar, then create calendar events.

It would also be pretty cool to see how setting up an application like this works in TypeScript.  Since I am going to be on PEXP, it makes sense to me to learn about that stuff. Hey, maybe I can do both lol.

I will need to parse the JSON regardless.
